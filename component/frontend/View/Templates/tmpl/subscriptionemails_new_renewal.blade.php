    Your [LEVEL] subscription renewal at [SITENAME]

    Thank you for your loyalty!

    <p>
        We confirm that we have successfully received the payment for your [LEVEL] subscription renewal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The renewed subscription will start counting when your previous [LEVEL] subscription was set to expire, namely on [PUBLISH_UP]. It will be active until [PUBLISH_DOWN]. This way you did not lose any subscription time by renewing early <em>and</em> you go to pay less. Awesome!
    </p>
    <p>
        We will send you an email around [PUBLISH_UP] to remind you that your renewal becomes active.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again, thank you for being with us! It is very much appreciated.
    </p>
