		 * This is an insane amount of tests and I mean it literally. The number of interactions between features we are
		 * allowing here is not sane and I am not even sure I have not forgotten something important. When I started
		 * writing these tests there were barely two dozen. Throughout the day I realised that this number was way too
		 * low and didn't cover a myriad of cases I can reasonably expect real-world clients to bump into.
		 *
		 * All that said and done, there are some cases that are too rare to programmatically deal with. For example,
		 * what happens if someone has bought renewals for level X for the next five years but suddenly decides to
		 * upgrade to level Y? Conversely, what happens if the client has already purchased a renewal to a bundle but
		 * now wants to downgrade? What happens when the client wants to downgrade but there's no level relation to tell
		 * the system to start the downgrade subscription after the currently active bundle subscription is over?
		 *
		 * The last case is simple: just create the damn relationship! The first two are nigh impossible to reasonably
		 * handle and the only answer that makes sense is "talk to a human and figure this shit out".
		 *
		 * Still, I have that feeling that I'm missing something. But whatâ€¦?
