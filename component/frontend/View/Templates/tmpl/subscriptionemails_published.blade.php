    <p>We'd like to remind you that you have registered on our site using the username

    <h3>Why am I receiving this email?</h3>
    <p>
        You had purchased a renewal to your [LEVEL] subscription on [SUB:CREATED_ON], before your previous subscription expired. The renewal you bought is a new subscription which was remained paid but remained inactive until your previous subscription expired. This way you did not lose any subscription time or money by renewing early. This email confirms that the previous subscription expired and the renewal subscription is now activated. All good!
    </p>
